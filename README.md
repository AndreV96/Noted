## Description

The purpose of this application is to create a text editor that can be open in any browser with the deployment link and that can be used offline without internet connection. When the user opens the webpage he will be presented with the text editor where he will be able to start working on a new project with javascript. Once he is finished with his project or wants to test he will be able to install with the install button and he will be able to access the project through a file on his desktop. He will then be able to deploy and use his newly generated website or application.
